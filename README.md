# Infrastructure Projects (Terraform/CloudFormation)

## Terraform projects include...

- (AWS) Created an architecture with 4 ec2 instances in a VPC architecture that is highly available.
- (Azure) Simple Web Architecture
- (AWS) S3 creation

## CloudFormation projects include...
- (AWS) Created a VPC architecture housing an EC2 instance

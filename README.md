These are Personal Projects that I have create on the side. Please go ahead and view
the different archiectures I have built.

Terraform projects include...
-(AWS) EKS sample architecture (needs to be worked on)
-(AWS) VPC architecture with a web server and database server with an ASG. I am able to create
 6 subnets but having issues with the NAT Gateway choosing the subnet. (Will look into replacing
 the database with RDS or DynamoDB.)
-(Azure) Simple Web Architecture
-(AWS) S3 creation

CloudFormation projects include...
-(AWS) EC2 instances combined with Auto Scaling and a Load Balancer (currently working on)

Soon to come:
--Containerization with AWS & more in-depth with Kubernetes

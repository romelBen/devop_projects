These are Personal Projects that I have create on the side. Please go ahead and view
the different archiectures I have built.

Terraform projects include...
-(AWS) EKS sample architecture (needs to be worked on)
-(AWS) VPC architecture with a web server and database server (what can be done is either going Serverless with replacing DB instance with Aurora MySQL or DynamoDB)
-(Azure) Simple Web Architecture
-(AWS) S3 creation

CloudFormation projects include...
-(AWS) EC2 instances combined with Auto Scaling and a Load Balancer (currently working on)

Soon to come:

# Infrastructure Projects (Terraform/CloudFormation)

## Terraform projects include...
- (AWS) VPC architecture with a web server and database server with an ASG. I am able to create
 6 subnets but having issues with the NAT Gateway choosing the subnet. (Needs to be worked on)
- (AWS) Created a VPC architecture with 4 EC2 instances combined with an ASG that has Microsoft SQL Server installed. (Trying to find a way of scripting EBS volumes on all 4 instances if the instance is to fail.) 
- (AWS) Created a VPC architecture with an EC2 instance combined with an ASG that has Jenkins and Docker installed.
- (AWS) S3 creation
- (Azure) Simple Web Architecture


## CloudFormation projects include...
- (AWS) Created a VPC architecture housing an EC2 instance
- (AWS) Created a VPC architecture with a EC2 instance (private instance), Load Balancer, and a Bastion Host (public instance).

## Soon to come:
- (AWS) EKS sample architecture (needs to be worked on)

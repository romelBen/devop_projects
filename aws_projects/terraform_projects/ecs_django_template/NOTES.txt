# NOTES.txt

Before you build your architecture, you must create your Key Pair in AWS to attach to your EC2 instances.
When you enter "terraform apply" you will be prompted to enter your ECS Cluster Name and your key. The .pem
key should be entered like so: "bevy-keypair". From there, Terraform will begin to build your architecture.

After finishing the build, Terraform will output your Internet Gateway, ALB DNS, public and private
subnets that were used. To access the site, please copy the URL that is outputted. Should look like this:
Bevy-ALB-1947320852.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

When you run "terraform apply" the AWS ECS Cluster will be built. Once entering the site you
will come across the site unadjusted with the static files missing (html, css, and javascript.)
What needs to be done (which I was trying to do on my side) is use boto3 with django-storages
to push the static files to S3 and cache with CloudFront. It can also be done using Nginx or Apache.
This will allow the site to use Django's static files where the user will receive error 404. If you want
to see your logs from the site, go to CloudWatch ---> click on Log Groups (on your left side) ---> and
then click on Log Group "/ecs/frontend-container". Here you will be able to view your logs of your container.

To connect to the EC2 instances, you must go to the "Bastion" ASG and enable 1 instance on "minimum"
and "desired". The ASG will then bring up an EC2 instance for use to access your EC2 instances.

IMPORTANT: When tearing down the architecture with "terraform destroy" you MUST manually delete the Auto
Scaling Group then "Terminate" the instances that are running. From here, you can then tear down the architecture
with no problems.

Note: If you receive an error on a aws_service_linked_role not able to be deleted. Go ahead and run
"terraform destroy" again. It will delete it once you input "destroy" again.

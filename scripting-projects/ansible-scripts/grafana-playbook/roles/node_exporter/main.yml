### Node Exporter will allow OS metrics on multiple hardware to be exposed so you can pull data and visualize in Grafana.
### Node Exporter will be downloaded to /tmp directory, a folder will be created in /opt, extract then modify the Service File,
### create a system reload, and finally start up the service. To connect to the server, the URL is https://localhost:9100/.

# Debian/Ubuntu Setup
This project is for my personal reasoning to install all the necessary applications I need for day-to-day
work and personal time.

Files that will be installed are as follows:

- Setup a user
- Transfer my local key to my desired host (will not be needed if you run this setup on local host)
- Add PPA repository to keep up-to-date on Vagrant, Git, Timeshift, and Yubico
- Add Node.js, Docker, VSC, Terraform, Python3, deepin-terminal and remmina
- Enable Bluetooth services
- Configure NTP for time
- Configure UFW to allow SSH and deny all other incoming traffic

## Other areas that I need to overview
I want to see what I can do with VSC extensions because there are quite a handful I would want to install
into the system. I am having a hard time but that will be put to the side for now for other projects I want to
jump on.
